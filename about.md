# Club's description

The perception of color in all living organisms is limited to a small sliver in the infinite continuum of the electromagnetic spectrum. Normal human vision (trichromacy) is even more limited than some animals. Some birds, for example, can see ultraviolet light, and some snakes can see into the infrared. These regions of the spectrum can be revealed using modern cameras and visualized by humans using false color techniques.

This is why we prepared an awesome club full of material and examples to learn how to develop an awesome science project.
