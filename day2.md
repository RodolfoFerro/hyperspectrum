**Artificial neural networks (ANN)** are computing systems that are inspired by, but not necessarily identical to, the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems "_learn_" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.


### Can a single neuron make a simple decision?

We are going to learn how to program an artificial neuron and see how it can make a simple decision. We will create a new Python class called `perceptron` and define its decision function.

### How does a neuron do the training?

We are going to learn how a neuron is trained based on examples. We will program an artificial neuron and train it for a specific function and see how it will be able to make a new prediction.

### Convolutional neural networks

In this section we are going to learn more about image processes, what a convlotion is, what convolutional networks are for and how they are very useful to work with computer vision problems that require modern _artificial intelligence_ solutions.
